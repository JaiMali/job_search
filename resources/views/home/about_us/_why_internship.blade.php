      <li>While college education is necessary, it seldom teaches you the appropriate skills you would require when you step out to do a job. It doesn’t matter if you are the topper of your batch or someone who just scraped through, if you do not know how to do your job or what exactly to do when certain things are expected off you, then your value at the firm lessens. Also seeming clueless for your first day at work can be a major put-off.</li>
      <li>We at Accelaar understand this very well and thus plead students to take as many internship opportunities as possible preferably but not necessarily in their field of pursue as even though the technical or commercial skills are important, dealing with bosses, achieving targets and meeting deadlines are equally important. Thus rather than doing 1 internship in your vacations, one should rather do as many of them as possible to just get some experience under your belt. The more filled your CV is at the time of your first job, bigger the bargaining chip you carry. If you don’t agree with all that you must agree that it’s at least better than sitting ideal.</li>
      <li>Internships can do for you what your GPA never will. It catapults you ahead of the lot. Having a big time internship on your resume and rounding it up with 4-5 small time essential internships makes your CV nothing short of an armour which will land you a job/offer that you would not get otherwise.</li>
      <li>Apart from job offers, internships are also essential for you to get admission in top colleges for your MS or MBA as having experience propels you closer to a seat in your desired college. Thus no matter what your play or where you apply having work experience only accentuates your application.</li>
      <li>If you still don’t agree, ask around a bit, talk with your friends, teachers, parents, other acquaintances, we are sure they will tell you the same.</li>
