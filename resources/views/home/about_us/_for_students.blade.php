    <li>Get all fitting opportunities served on a platter.</li>
    <li>Refrain from having to browse the website everyday (as if it’s facebook) hoping to spot the right internship</li>
    <li>Save time from answering inessential questions like “Why should we hire you?” over and over again</li>

      <li>We at Accelaar are dedicated towards helping you find the right internship but we also want to achieve it by utilising very little time of yours. We understand that a college student’s life can be busy between classes, friends, studies, parents, extra-curricular activities etc. and even if it’s not busy for a day or two, nobody wants to waste it on finding an internship, especially when we are there for you.</lI>
      <li>We only charge 1% of your total stipend as our fees (not that we can put a price on the exposure you get) and that too after you receive your stipend from your employer.</lI>
      <li>This means upon getting paid Rs.5000, you pay us Rs.50 NOT Rs.500. The end amount you get will be Rs.4950.</lI>
      <li>Rather than creating an account on many sites and logging on to each and every one to only check whether there are internships opportunities available, we recommend you to only make your profile once on Accelaar and let us do all the finding for you. Even if you are not actively looking for an internship, you must then devote just 10 minutes to fill up the details on our website and keep your profile on there, we might just bring you an offer which will amp you up and make you internship driven. Besides it’s also important for you to know where you stand in the job market and the demand for your profile.</lI>
      <li>Anyhow creating a profile doesn’t cost you anything apart from 10 minutes of your time and if just filling a few details can help your career advance then why wait?</lI>
      <li>If you still are second guessing then just try it because…. let’s face it…. what’s there to lose? We at Accelaar will prove it to you that your 10 minutes of form filling was a cheap deal against what you would get in return.</lI>
