      <li>Students interested in undertaking an internship must register themselves on the website and fill up all the fields mentioned accurately for best results.</li>
      <li>Similarly companies/HR teams/individual recruiters who are interested in hiring an intern must register themselves as ‘recruiters’ on the website and fill up all the details regarding the internship proposal.</li>
      <li>Then we pair the profiles of interns with the internship offers on the basis of various fields (qualification, availability and skill based) and keeping the personal interests and demands of both the parties in mind.</li>
      <li>The recruiters then receive the desired number of CV’s of interns which are forwarded to them only after each individual’s go ahead.</li>
      <li>From here on the recruiter’s decide which intern to call up for an interview and which to not and whom to hire is completely up to the recruiter.</li>
      <li>We receive our payment when the interns get their stipend.</li>
      <li>Thus we get paid only after you get paid.</li>
